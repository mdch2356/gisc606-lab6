    "#Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)\n",
    "    #The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a quantitative index of greenness \n",
    "        #ranging from 0-1 where 0 represents minimal or no greenness and 1 represents maximum greenness.\n",
    "#Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)\n",
    "    #The Normalized burn ratio (NBR) is used to identify burned areas. The formula is similar to a \n",
    "        #normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), except that it uses near-infrared (NIR) and \n",
    "        #shortwave-infrared (SWIR) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n",
    "#NBR Bands\n",
    "    #The NBR index was originally developed for use with Landsat TM and ETM+ bands 4 and 7, but it \n",
    "        #will work with any multispectral sensor with a NIR band between 760 - 900 nm and a SWIR band \n",
    "        #between 2080 - 2350 nm. Thus this index can be used with both Landsat 8, MODIS and other multi \n",
    "        #(and hyper) spectral sensors.\n",
    "#Difference NBR\n",
    "    #The Normalized Burn Ratio is most powerful as a tool to better understand fire extent and severity \n",
    "        #when used after calculating the difference between pre and post fire conditions. This difference \n",
    "        #is best measured using data collected immediately before the fire and then immediately after the fire. "
